# Troubleshooting Your Boutique Client Portal Deployment

This guide provides solutions to the common deployment issues you are facing, based on the findings from your successful deployment report dated January 8, 2025.

-----

## Problem 1: Rate Limit Error (`429 Too Many Requests`)

You are seeing the error `{"error":{"type":"rate_limit","statusCode":429},"success":false}`. Your deployment report indicates this is caused by aggressive rate-limiting rules within the application code.

### Solution: Disable Rate Limiting

The documented solution is to disable this feature using an environment variable.

1.  **Edit your PM2 Configuration:** Open your `ecosystem.config.js` file on the server.

2.  **Add the Environment Variable:** Ensure the `env` section of your configuration includes the `DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING: 'true'` variable. It should look like this:

    ```javascript
    {
      name: 'boutique-client-portal',
      script: 'npm run dev',
      cwd: '/home/admin/boutiqueclient',
      env: {
        NODE_ENV: 'production',
        DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING: 'true', // <-- Ensure this line is present
        HOST: '0.0.0.0',
        PORT: '5173'
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Restart the Application:** Apply the changes by restarting your application through PM2.

    ```bash
    pm2 restart boutique-client-portal
    ```

## Problem 2: Blank Login Page

A blank page typically indicates a server-side error preventing the page from rendering. Your report identified two potential root causes for this during the previous deployment.

  * **Cause A:** The backend API failed because a critical file, `/src/lib/server/prisma.js`, was missing.
  * **Cause B:** The Prisma client failed to build correctly for the NixOS server architecture. The temporary solution was to run the application in development mode to bypass this build step.

### Solution: Debug and Verify

1.  **Check Application Logs:** This is the most important step. The logs will contain the specific server-side error. Use this command to view them:

    ```bash
    pm2 logs boutique-client-portal
    ```

    Look for any errors mentioning `Prisma`, `database`, `connect`, or `failed to fetch`.

2.  **Verify the `dev` Mode Workaround:** The successful deployment relied on running the application in development mode to solve a Prisma build issue. Confirm that your `ecosystem.config.js` file is using `'npm run dev'` as the script.

    ```javascript
    {
      name: 'boutique-client-portal',
      script: 'npm run dev', // <-- Verify this is being used
      // ...
    }
    ```

3.  **Verify Project Files:** Ensure all necessary files from your local project were successfully cloned or copied to the `/home/admin/boutiqueclient` directory on the server, especially everything inside `/src/lib/server/`.

## ⚠️ Important Note: Production Mode

The deployment report clearly states that using `'npm run dev'` is a **temporary solution** to get around a Prisma client build issue on NixOS.

For long-term stability, security, and performance, you should follow the recommendation in the "Future Enhancements" section of your report to create a **proper production build**. This involves resolving the underlying Prisma issue for NixOS.
