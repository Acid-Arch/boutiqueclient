3. Creates `boutique-client` service user
4. Sets up directory structure at `/opt/boutique-client`
5. Configures UFW firewall and fail2ban security
6. Configures Nginx with IP-only settings

### Application Deployment Phase
1. Clones repository to `/opt/boutique-client/app`
2. Installs production dependencies
3. Switches to IP-only authentication
4. Configures production environment
5. Generates Prisma client and runs migrations
6. Builds the application
7. Starts services with PM2

### Testing Phase
1. Tests health endpoint
2. Verifies main application loads
3. Checks login functionality
4. Confirms WebSocket connectivity

## 🛡️ Security Measures

- **UFW Firewall** - Only essential ports open (22, 80, 3000, 8081)
- **fail2ban** - Protection against brute force attacks
- **Service user** - Application runs as non-root `boutique-client` user
- **File permissions** - Secure permissions on all files
- **Rate limiting** - Nginx configured with rate limiting
- **Security headers** - CSP, XSS protection, frame options

## 🔄 Migration to Domain (Later)

When ready to add a domain:

1. **Point domain** to 5.78.147.68
2. **Restore OAuth** authentication:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/boutique-client/app/src
   mv auth.ts auth-ip-only.ts.backup
   mv auth-oauth.ts.backup auth.ts
   ```
3. **Configure SSL** with Let's Encrypt
4. **Update environment** variables for domain URLs
5. **Update Nginx** configuration for HTTPS
